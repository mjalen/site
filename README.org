** About/Why

This is a personal site project inspired by the existence of HTMX. This project has a few goals:

- I love Common Lisp (CL), but I could be much more comfortable in it. Write a project in a domain I am familiar with (web dev) while learning more about CL.
- Aim to use HTMX where-ever I would usually reach for React.
- Have fun :)
